## Introduction

The **Movie Database** is a multi-page web application built to provide users with an intuitive, immersive experience when searching and discovering movies. Developed over three days, the project showcases skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating the TMDb API for real-time movie data.

The appâ€™s design takes inspiration from *The Matrix*, employing a dark, sci-fi aesthetic with neon green accents and a custom animated digital rain canvas background. The theme balances style with usability to engage users while providing a seamless browsing experience.
